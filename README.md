# Chrome Domoticz

This is a small python script using pychromecast to propegate status from my chromecast into domoticz

It also implement a simple webservice to control the chromecast, which I have used in a companion dashboard

It is a quick hack at the moment, but it works for me.. If implementing this elsewehere, go through the code and update urls etc.

The listed audio / video streams (in chrome.py) is mainly for some danish tv/radio channels
